* Classes
    * In this code, we simulated a turn-based battle simulator which runs based on user input on the GUI
In order to do so, we created various Pokemon classes which determine the attributes of the Pokemon and their respective moves
To correspond to this, a types class was added to list the types available and their respective relationships with one another
For display, an action menu was added to display the moves of each respective Pokemon on the playerâ€™s team
Furthermore, a rules class was added to read and load a json file, which portrays in text the instructions and attributes of the game
Finally, all of the aforementioned classes are imported to the controller, which dictates the display and flow of the game
